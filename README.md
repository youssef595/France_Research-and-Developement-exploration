Exploration of the Research and Development landscape in France

* Part of my research internship at Leyton Morocco where i was involved in an R&D tax prediction project; one of the tasks was to feed the initial client database with external R&D and economic related features. In this repository i explore the scrapping of an R&D platform named SCANR and conversion of the data to a tabular data containing many R&D features related to companies publications and projects. 
* After the end of the internship and during the NLP course, i launched a project related to scientific papers semantic similarity.
* In the coming days, many insights and implementations will be shared in this repository.
